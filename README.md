## Using anotherUI in Your Project ⛓️‍💥

To integrate this library into your project:

1. Install the package:

   ```bash
   pnpm install another-ui
   ```

2. Import the components you need:

   ```tsx
   import { Button } from 'another-ui';
   ```

3. Add Tailwind CSS configuration from `twPlugin/tokens` to your `tailwind.config.js` for design consistency:

   ```js
   const anotherUIConfig = require('another-ui/twPlugin/tokens');

   module.exports = {
     content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
     theme: {
       extend: anotherUIConfig,
     },
     plugins: [anotherUIPlugin],
   };
   ```

## Design Tokens 🎨

The `twPlugin` directory includes:

- **Primitives**: Core values (e.g., colors, spacings) used to build the theme.
- **Tokens**: High-level design tokens for typography, color schemes, etc.

These tokens ensure a consistent design language across components. They can be extended or overridden based on project needs.
